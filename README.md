  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <br>
  The process of encoding information, which is conversion of the original representation of the information 
  known as ‘plain text’, into an alternative form known as ‘cipher text’ is called encryption.
  Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

  Problem Statement:
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal of this project is to design a system of units that communicate between each other via end-to-end encryption. The RSA            encryption algorithm will be used and the user will be able to choose the kind of encryption. The aim is to achieve secure                communication between two digital systems.
